About
=====
The **pyOCCT** project provides Python bindings to the OpenCASCADE 7.4.0 geometry kernel and SMESH
8.3.0 meshing library via pybind11. Together, this technology stack enables rapid CAD/CAE
application development in the popular Python programming language.

## Enabling technology
The pyOCCT core technology stack includes:

* `OpenCASCADE <https://www.opencascade.com>`_: Open CASCADE Technology (OCCT) is an object-oriented
  C++ class library designed for rapid production of sophisticated domain-specific CAD/CAM/CAE
  applications.

* `Salome Platform <http://www.salome-platform.org>`_: Open-source software that provides a generic
  pre- and post-processing platform for numerical simulation. It is based on an open and flexible
  architecture made of reusable components.

* `Netgen <https://ngsolve.org/>`_: Advanced meshing capabilities including 3-D tetrahedral and 2-D
  unstructured quad-dominated surface meshing.

* `pybind11 <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11>`_: A lightweight header-only library that exposes
  C++ types in Python and vice versa, mainly to create Python bindings of existing C++ code.
